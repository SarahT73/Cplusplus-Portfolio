# Cplusplus-Portfolio

This project was to create a program that would be used to teach high school students about investing and the strength of compound interest.

It allows them to enter an initial investment amount, monthly deposit amount, and number of years over which they will track the investment,
then outputs the accrued interest for each year. 

One of the elements of this project I am most proud of is the menu formatting and the ease of use for the user and that the contents of 
main is very simple and clean. That was one of my main learning goals with this project was to keep as much code out of the main.cpp file
as possible, and I am very happy with how I was able to achieve it, but it was also one of the most challening pieces of the code for me.

This was a challenge because though I have worked with classes and multiple files before I was a little out of practice with it, and don't
believe I had truly grasped the concept unitl I started working through it on this project. I started with creating all the code inside the main
function, and once it was working as I intended, created the functions, moving the code to the appropriate functions. This may not be the most
efficient way, but it helped me to visualize the best way to divide the functions and their operations while making it easier to debug if the
program began to have errors as I already knew the logic worked, so any issues that arose would be from my function implementations and calls.

One important elemnts of this code that I would like to enhance is error catching for user input. It wasn't required in the inital program
so I didn't add it in, but it's a very important step that shouldn't be overlooked, and this would be the FIRST thing I would update the code
with when I get the chance. This would make the code more secure and ensure that a small typo from the end user doesn't throw the program into
a never ending loop or crash.

There are many skills from this project I will carry foward into other projects and course work. As an example, this project was instrumental
in beginning to understand references and pointers, whereas before I didn't understand how or when to use them. I now have a much better
understanding that will carry foward with me. I also got a better grasp of classes and different files within a program working on this project.
	
The program itself is meade readable and maintainable by adding inline comments about the functionality of functions and special lines of code
and their purpose. I also use a line between different "sections" of code and using industry standard indentation and coding practices. The program
is also adapltable by virtue of keeping main and the header file as clean as possible so that the bulk of the functionality comes from the class cpp
file. This allows that changes or additons to the code would need to be written there, with just a function declaration in the header file and any
calls to the function in main.
